# LOGISTIC-REGRESSION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION-
📊 Logistic Regression and Data Visualization Project
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. The notebook includes complete steps from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, model building, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

The objective of this project is to understand how logistic regression works mathematically and practically, while also visualizing the dataset to gain meaningful insights.
